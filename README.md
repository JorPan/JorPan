*On a quick trip in the Grand Canyon*

I am an inquisitive self-driven full stack web developer with a deep passion for exploring new technologies via coding, photography, video editing, projection mapping, and music production and performance. 

I transitioned from Software Sales to Software Development based on my natural enthusiasm
towards algorithmic problem-solving and my eagerness to be a life-long learner. I believe that any complex problem can be broken down into manageable chunks and solved with due diligence.

🎵 Designed for DJ's and modern performers, SetLy allows arist users to store, view, and edit their song library. Then they can use the camelot circle of 5ths to build a new set from their library matching the key and tempo of each track, and using intuitive Drag and Drop capabilities. Artist users can then keep track of concert data, not only what songs they played, but also how many tickets they sold and the revenue they earned. Concert Goers can click on past shows to see the full set list, and add to their past concert list, accunlating data like how many times they've seen a certain artist play their favorite song.
