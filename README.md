*Recently returned from a quick trip to the Grand Canyon*

I am an inquisitive self-driven full stack web developer with a deep passion for exploring new technologies via coding, photography, video editing, projection mapping, and music production and performance. 

I transitioned from Software Sales to Software Development based on my natural enthusiasm
towards algorithmic problem-solving and my eagerness to be a life-long learner. I believe that any complex problem can be broken down into manageable chunks and solved with due diligence.
