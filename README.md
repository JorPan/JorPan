# Hello! I'm Jordan! 🎵 🎺 🎹 📷 🎥 💻 🏂 ⛳ 

I am an inquisitive self-driven full stack web developer with a passion for exploring modern technologies.

I transitioned from Software Sales to Software Development based on my natural enthusiasm
towards algorithmic problem-solving and my eagerness to be a life-long learner. 

I believe that any complex problem can be broken down into manageable chunks and solved with due diligence. 

I am incredibly passionate about everything I do, from snowboarding and golfing to exploring new technologies via coding, photography, video editing, projection mapping, and music production & performance.

I am a professional Googler.
